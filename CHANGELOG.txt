2013-09-05	0.5.2
NEW
	* New "Indent aware filter" to filter exceptions.
	* Colored logs ! Weeee !!
IMPROVED
	* Opening a file now displays the newly opened tab.
	* Tab switching using ctrl-tab ctrl-shift-tab.
	* Running without -u is now much better. It relies on commons-io's Tailer instead of my buggy implementation.
	* Screen notification are now *FABULOUUUUS*
	* Performance
	* Look & Feel is now configurable.
FIXED
	* Opening files used the file name instead of the file path, so file wouldn't be read most of the time.
	* In some cases, clearing a console would deadlock the application. Should be ok now.
BROKEN
	* Scroll lock menu temporarily disabled (use scroll lock key)
	* Line numbering is temporarily disabled
	* Running without -u breaks -n (all previous lines are read, not a set number).
